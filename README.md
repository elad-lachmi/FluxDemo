# FluxDemo
We are starting out a new SPA and have decided to go with ReactJS.
Since we are using React, we also want to implement a Flux architecture, which ties in very well to React.
I am creating this Repo to flesh out a working example of our intended architecture and stack in order to create a reference project when we begin actual development.
Over time I will be adding modules that we will need to create a working application.

The initial code was inspired by https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-simple-shopping-cart-with-react-js-and-flux.
